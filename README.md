<h1>Guardian of the Galaxy (Game)</h1>
<p>
If we understand computer graphics simply, it deals with creation, manipulation and storage of images and objects. In this project we have used computer graphics concepts to develop a 2D single player game. The game we have developed is inspired from the 1978’s famous game ‘Space Invaders’. In this project we have tried to apply the same mechanics of the game in our project. For the development of the game we have used Python3 and Pygame module. </p>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>
Computer graphics is responsible for the creation, manipulation, and storage of objects, images. Everything we see on our laptops, televisions, mobile screens is related to computer graphics. Computer graphics has several applications. Computer Art, Computer-aided drawing, Presentation Graphics, Entertainment, Education, Training, Visualisation, Image Processing, Machine Drawing, and Graphical User Interface are all major applications of computer graphics. To apply and understand more about the concepts of computer graphics we have developed a game. In this innovative project of computer graphics, we tried to learn more and more about the mechanics of game development and how computer graphics is important for its development. Computer graphics play an important role in game development. There has been a lot of development in computer graphics over many years. The performance in computer graphics has become much better than in comparison to a few decades back. In the late 20th century, the computer graphics were mainly pixellated. Now the advancement in technologies, opened the gates for the gaming world to develop high-resolution games. Gamers can play games in high-resolution on their mobile phones and computer.
In computer graphics, we learnt many basic concepts, and we applied those concepts in our game. We worked on a project to develop a 2D shooting game. 
The Guardian of the Galaxy is a 2D single-player game.
The Guardian of the Galaxy is based upon 1978’s famous arcade game Space Invaders developed by Taito Corporation.
The game is developed using python. 
The game is simple to understand but challenging to play, you will be controlling a spaceship, you are going to face a lot of enemy ships, their main motive is to destroy your ship. You have to be careful and extra dodgy; your laser weapon is powerful; it can take out the enemy ship in a single fire. You have a powerful defence but it can only save you for some time so remember you are not immune to enemy fire.

Motivation
</h3>
<p>
There has been a significant increase in the gaming world, the interests of developers, gamers, fans have been increasing a lot in the recent times. Due to the streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube people are attracting towards games. And because of the pandemic situation people were forced to stay inside their homes, which also contributed in the growing interests of people in the gaming world. If we talk about India, around 80% of games played are for mobile phones. We have a huge audience for mobile games, but the problem is we don’t have many gaming studios and game developers. People do like to play games but there are not many companies for game developments. The main reason for building this game was to learn more about the gaming world and explore this path. As the students of Computer Engineering, we should always be innovative and should focus on more unique things.

How to Play!!:
</h3>

<p>
When you run the script, you’ll land on the main screen of the game where you’ll be asked to press the keyboard button or mouse button. This will start the game. From there the main game loop will start. The player will register the input from the keyboard which will be recorded. The game will record the hits and will update the results, scores, lives and levels in the game. If a player loses all 5 lives, then the game will be over and the player will be redirected to Main Screen.
